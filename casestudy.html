        <h1>Plant Health API</h1>

        <div class="oneProjectOverview">
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>The Plant Health API is an early-stage digital tool designed to help gardeners and farmers 
                monitor, diagnose, and improve plant health through data-driven insights. The API aims to 
                connect data from multiple sources, including environmental sensors, user input, and image recognition 
                models to provide actionable recommendations for common plant health issues such as pests, diseases, 
                nutrient deficiencies, or environmental stress. Users can submit real-time data such as soil moisture, 
                temperature, humidity, or leaf images, and the API will process this input and return information on the plant, 
                plant disease, and potential treatments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="oneNeedsAssessment">
        <h3> Needs Assessment and Materials List</h3>
        <p>There are a few skills that can help build an API tool. For this project, refer to the skills below. <p>
            <ul>HTML, CSS, and Javascript Languages</ul>
            <ul>API Key - I obtained mine with Plant.id by signing up with an email for free!</ul>
            <ul>VS Code/Working Device: You will need somewhere to store your code and run your results.</ul>
            <ul>Working Wi-Fi and internet. The API will not work unless connected.</ul>
            <ul>Camera and photo upload so that the plant health can be processed.</ul>
        </div>

        <div class="oneProjectAnalysis">
        <h3>Project Analysis</h3>
            <p>By integrating sensor data, user inputs, and image recognition, the API can help users identify plant health 
                problems earlier and with more accuracy than traditional observation alone. This centralized system empowers 
                home gardeners, small farmers, and even educators to monitor plant health dynamically, using accessible 
                digital tools instead of relying solely on expert field visits.</p> 
        </div>

        <div class="oneChallengesSolutions">
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <ul>A primary challenge for the Plant Health API is achieving reliable accuracy with diverse plant species and 
                conditions. Factors such as inconsistent photo quality, varied lighting, or incomplete sensor data can lead 
                to misdiagnoses. Building a robust image recognition model requires training on thousands of plant images 
                across different growth stages, climates, and disease types, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. 
                Additionally, integrating third-party hardware like soil sensors or smart garden devices adds complexity, 
                requiring clear data standards and secure connections to ensure user privacy and consistent performance.</ul>
            <ul>To address these challenges, the development team plans to start with a focused library of high-quality, 
                verified plant images for common species and problems, expanding gradually through community contributions 
                and partnerships with agricultural research groups. Basic rule-based checks can provide backup guidance when 
                image confidence is low, ensuring users always get helpful feedback. For hardware integration, the API will 
                use secure, standardized endpoints and clear documentation to make it easy for third-party devices to share 
                reliable data. In the long term, combining user feedback with machine learning will refine the API’s accuracy, 
                making it a powerful, practical tool for sustainable plant health management at any scale.</ul>
        </div>

        <div class="oneResultsConclusion">
        <h3>Results and Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>The early pilot of the Plant Health API showed promising results in helping users detect and address common plant health 
                issues more quickly and confidently. During initial testing, the API successfully identified common leaf diseases such 
                as powdery mildew and early blight. The API's recommendations were practical and easy to follow, making the tool helpful
                as a new farmer.</ul>
            <ul>The pilot results highlight the value of combining technology with accessible plant care. By integrating simple environmental 
                sensors, user-submitted photos, and smart diagnostics into a single tool, the Plant Health API makes expert-level guidance 
                available to anyone with a phone or basic monitoring device. As development continues, expanding the plant database, refining 
                the image recognition model, and improving third-party device compatibility will help the API serve an even wider range of crops 
                and growing conditions. Ultimately, a reliable Plant Health API could play a small but important role in promoting local food 
                security, healthier gardens, and more resilient small-scale agriculture by giving people the knowledge they need to detect problems 
                early and manage plant health sustainably.</ul>

        <h1>At-Home Hydroponics</h1>

        <div class="twoProjectOverview">
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>A Deep Water Culture (DWC) system is a simple yet highly effective hydroponic method that suspends plant roots directly in a nutrient-rich, 
                oxygenated water solution. Unlike traditional soil gardening, DWC allows plants to absorb nutrients and oxygen more efficiently, leading 
                to faster growth and higher yields — making it an excellent choice for growing heavy-feeding fruiting crops like tomatoes and cucumbers at 
                home. With just a few key pieces of equipment and basic maintenance, an at-home DWC system can produce fresh, vine-ripened tomatoes and 
                crisp cucumbers year-round, even in limited space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="twoNeedsAssessment">
        <h3> Needs Assessment </h3>
        <p>There are a number of considerations for growing tomatoes and cucumbers using an at-home DWC system.</p>
            <ul>Space & Location: You’ll need an area with enough room for the reservoir, plant canopy, and trellising. Ensure access to power for pumps 
                and grow lights.</ul>
            <ul>Lighting: Make sure plants get at least 12-16 hours of direct light daily. This may vary across crops.</ul>
            <ul>Structural Support: Tomatoes and cucumbers are vining crops. You’ll need sturdy trellises to support the 
                plants as they grow vertically.</ul>
            <ul>Water & Nutrient Management: A reliable water source for topping off the reservoir. A way to monitor and maintain water temperature, 
                pH, and nutrient strength.Easy access to drain and clean the system.</ul>
            <ul>Air & Oxygenation: A quality air pump with stones sized for your reservoir.</ul>
            <ul>Time & Maintenance: Low-maintenance day-to-day but do require weekly nutrient checks, water level top-offs, regular monitoring 
                for algae, root health, or pests.</ul>
        </div>

        <div class="twoMaterialsList">
        <h3> Materials List </h3>
            <ul>Reservoir container: A large opaque storage tote or plastic bin. Must carry a minimum of the total gallons of all buckets combined.</ul>
            <ul>Buckets: 5 Gallons each for tomatoes and cucumbers. May vary on crop species. <ul>
            <ul>Growing medium: Expanded clay pebbles, rockwool cubes, or hydroton to support the plants in the buckets.</ul>
            <ul>Air pump: Sized for the volume of water. Many DWC systems will come with an air pump unless specified.</ul>
            <ul>Air stones: 1–2 medium or large air stones for good oxygen dispersion.</ul>
            <ul>Airline tubing & check valves: To connect pump to air stones.</ul>
            <ul>Hydroponic nutrients: Balanced nutrient solution suitable for fruiting plants.</ul>
            <ul>pH test kit or digital meter: To keep nutrient solution pH in the ideal range (5.5–6.5).</ul>
            <ul>Lighting: Full-spectrum LED grow light(s).</ul>
        </div>

        <h3>2D/3D Design</h3>
        <img class="fullscreen-image" src="drawings [Converted].jpg" alt="Full Screen Example">
        </div>

        <div class="twoProjectAnalysis">
        <h3>Project Analysis</h3>
            <p>Placed in a backyard, this system uses a sturdy, opaque reservoir fitted with buckets 
                holding the plants in a floating or fixed lid. An electric air pump and air stones 
                continuously aerate the nutrient solution, supplying oxygen to the submerged root systems. 
                A simple trellis structure or vertical stakes supports the vining tomatoes and cucumbers as 
                they grow upward, maximizing vertical space and sunlight exposure. Operating a DWC outdoors 
                combines the advantages of abundant natural sunlight with the efficiency and water conservation 
                benefits of hydroponics.</p> 
            <p>Compared to conventional soil gardening, this system reduces weeding, 
                minimizes pest exposure in the soil, and uses nutrients more precisely. With basic regular maintenance, 
                monitoring water levels, nutrient strength, and pH, the system can produce multiple harvests of fresh, 
                healthy tomatoes and cucumbers right in the backyard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="twoChallengesSolutions">
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <ul>Challenge 1: Outdoor Temperature Fluctuations: Tomatoes and cucumbers thrive in warm conditions, but 
                extreme heat can raise the reservoir’s water temperature, lowering oxygen levels and stressing the 
                plants. Cold nights can have the opposite effect, slowing root activity.Place the reservoir in a shaded 
                spot during hot months or insulate it with reflective material to reduce heat gain. In colder weather, use 
                a small heater to maintain a stable water temperature. Monitoring with a simple water thermometer helps catch extremes early.</ul>
            <ul>Challenge 2: Pests & Outdoor Animals: Even though DWC avoids soil pests, backyard systems can attract insects, 
                birds, or small animals curious about the plants or nutrient water. Use netting or fencing to protect the plants 
                from larger animals. Inspect regularly for insects and treat infestations with gentle, non-toxic solutions suitable 
                for edible crops. Keep the area clean and free of debris to discourage pests.</ul>
        </div>

        <div class="twoResultsConclusion">
        <h3>Results and Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>After building and operating the backyard Deep Water Culture (DWC) system for a full season, if there are strong 
                yields from both tomatoes and cucumbers, on average, each tomato plant should produce 10–15 pounds of tomatoes 
                over the season, while each cucumber vine yielded about 15–20 pounds. In this backyard setup, just 4 tomato plants 
                and 4 cucumber plants produced a combined harvest of 100–140 pounds of fresh vegetables during the season. This 
                amount can supplement the vegetable needs of a small family of 2–4 people, providing enough tomatoes and cucumbers 
                for fresh salads, cooking, and preserving. Compared to a traditional backyard soil garden, the DWC system used water 
                more efficiently, required less weeding, and delivered consistent harvests with fewer pest issues.</ul>
            <ul>The backyard DWC system demonstrated that with minimal space and proper setup, a home grower can produce a significant 
                supply of fresh vegetables to support household nutrition. The system’s higher yields per plant and multiple harvests 
                make it a great alternative to traditional gardening, especially in urban or suburban areas where soil quality, space, 
                or water supply may be limited. Small-scale hydroponic projects like this can contribute meaningfully to local food security 
                by providing a stable source of nutritious produce close to where people live. By reducing dependence on supply chains and 
                minimizing food miles, such systems help communities build resilience against supply disruptions, rising food costs, or 
                seasonal shortages.</ul>

        <div class="brooklynGrange">
        <h3> Brooklyn Grange</h3>
        <p>Company Overview: Brooklyn Grange, founded in 2010 by Ben Flanner and Anastasia Cole Plakias, is a pioneering rooftop 
            farming and green-roof consultancy based in NYC. They operate three major rooftop farms across Brooklyn and Queens, 
            covering a total of 5.6 acres (≈140,000 ft²), and produce approximately 80,000–100,000 lbs of organic vegetables annually.<p>
        <p>Business Model: Their business model is robustly diversified across four main revenue streams. Produce sales such as farmers markets
            makes up just a small fraction of the company's revenue. Most of the company's money comes from hosting events. This 
            allows the farm to give away food for little to no cost to counter food insecurity. Additionally, green-roof consulting and installation for 
            commercial and institutional clients, including the Javits Center and private rooftops Brooklyn Grange. The final source of 
            revenue stems from collaborations with other groups for workshops and educational programs.</p>
        <p>Challenges and Solutions: Rooftop farming in NYC requires securing long-term leases and contending with high property costs.
            Extreme weather—heatwaves, heavy rainfall, wind, and pests—pose major risks to high-elevation crops. In the past, some plants
            were lost due to high winds. To counter the first challenge, Brooklyn Grange secured 15–20-year leases and diversified income 
            beyond produce to support rent, capital investments, and farming operations. For the second challenge, farmers divised 
            a system of wrapping the top layer of the soil in plastic wrap. This allows loose soil to stay in place, even in high winds.</p>

        <div class="farmOne">
        <h3> Farm.One </h3>
        <p>Company Overview: Founded in 2016 by Rob Laing in New York City, Farm.One is a vertical farm specializing in rare herbs, 
            edible flowers, and microgreens for high-end chefs and discerning consumers. Initially supplying over 40 Michelin-starred restaurants, 
            the farm grew more than 700 distinct microgreens and herbs in its Tribeca facility using hydroponic systems and IoT-based environmental 
            controls.Today, Farm.One operates from a 10,000 ft² indoor farm in Prospect Heights, delivering same-day harvested greens to over 300 
            weekly subscribers and select restaurants. <p>
        <p>Business Model: In 2020, with restaurant closures due to COVID-19, Farm.One pivoted to a direct-to-consumer (D2C) subscription model, 
            delivering weekly boxes of fresh greens to residents of Tribeca and Prospect Heights. In addition to their subscription
            service bringing in revenue, the farm location also hosts guests. Guests can order from the brewery and cafe in the farm.
            This same brewery not only brings in revenue, but works sybiotically with the farm's hydroponic system. The company achieves a third 
            source of revenue by offering tours to outsiders interested in the farm.</p>
        <p>Challenges and Solutions: In late 2022, Farm.One was acquired by DK-Bell and reopened its Prospect Heights operation. 
            The new investment funded facility upgrades, re-launch of restaurant supply, a public “Pavilion” event space, and sustainable zero-plastic 
            packaging</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>Farm.One and Brooklyn Grange are two standout examples of what modern urban agriculture can look like in a dense city like New York. 
                They share a common mission—local, sustainable food—but pursue it through very different business models, technologies, and community 
                roles. Farm.One operates small-footprint, indoor hydroponic vertical farms specializing in rare microgreens, herbs, and edible flowers. 
                It began by supplying Michelin-starred chefs with ultra-fresh produce grown a few subway stops away. When COVID-19 shut restaurants down, 
                Farm.One quickly pivoted to a direct-to-consumer subscription model, delivering curated weekly boxes of greens to local households. 
                This pivot kept them afloat and even built a loyal local following. They also generate revenue through agritourism—offering tours, tastings, 
                classes, and workshops—turning their farm into an experience, not just a supply chain.</p>
            <p>In contrast, Brooklyn Grange grows organic produce at scale on massive urban rooftops—over 135,000 square feet—making it the largest rooftop 
                soil farm in the world. Unlike Farm.One’s high-tech vertical stacks, Brooklyn Grange relies on soil-based, sun-powered growing—with low-tech 
                drip irrigation and companion planting. Its business model mixes direct produce sales with 
                strong diversification into green roof consulting, event rentals, and corporate workshops. This blended revenue approach 
                spreads risk and funds their broader mission of promoting green infrastructure and urban biodiversity.</p>

        <div class="threeConclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Farm.One and Brooklyn Grange succeed because they understand their local ecosystem, build trust with their communities, 
                and adapt when faced with disruption. Farm.One shows how high-tech, niche farming can thrive by delivering unique crops 
                with exceptional freshness—and by creating memorable urban experiences. Brooklyn Grange demonstrates that scalable, soil-based 
                farming can coexist with dense city life, transforming rooftops into productive green spaces that feed people, improve 
                sustainability, and build community resilience.</p>
